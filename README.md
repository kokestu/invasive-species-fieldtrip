# Modelling activity for the London NERC DTP Cohort 9 Field trip

Welcome to this modelling activity! We'll be looking at how we can use mathematical modelling to understand the long-term impacts of an invasive species.
The exercise itself can be viewed [here](https://github.com/kokestu/invasive-species-fieldtrip/blob/master/mink-invasion.md#modelling-the-invasive-american-mink-in-the-pyrenees).
In order to complete the exercises in the activity, you'll want to download the code [here](https://github.com/kokestu/invasive-species-fieldtrip/blob/master/mink-invasion.rmd) and open it in
R Studio (or another IDE of your choice).
