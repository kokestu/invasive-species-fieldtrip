Modelling the invasive American Mink in the Pyrenees
================

## The system

In the Pyrenees, several small carnivores compete for habitat and prey.
Of these, the [European
mink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_mink) is highly threatened,
due to competition with the invasive [American
mink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mink). The population of
European Mink in the Pyrenees is one of the last remaining in Europe,
and conservation of the species depends on us finding a way to mitigate
the threats in this region.

The European and American mink are both semi-aquatic
[mustelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae) which have
relatively small territories on rivers or coasts. They hunt small
rodents, birds, fish, and crustaceans. Despite the similarities that
have led to their common name, they are members of distinct evolutionary
lineages, with the European mink being more closely related to weasels
and ferrets than the American mink. Therefore, their similar lifestyles
are an example of [convergent
evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution).

As well as the two mink, other species with similar ranges include the
[red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox) and [European
badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_badger). Despite their
similar size and some overlap in food sources, these species have
importantly different [ecological
niches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche) to the mink,
with both being omnivorous and terrestrial. We will include these
species in the model to make it more realistic. It is possible to adjust
the model below to take account of the difference in diet and behaviour
which would mean that they interact less with the species of interest
(**TODO:** incorporate this?).

## The model

This model is taken from [Catford et
al.Â 2018](http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04491-3).

        \\left( m_i + \\sum_{j = 1}^{i-1} c_j p_j + h_j \\right) p_i")  

We assume all species make *universal trade-offs* (see
[Tilman 2011](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/661245)).

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
